Rationale behind is that as i am mainly web developer i wanted to create prototype, which i want to rewrite later
as plugin for [**Mod Dwarf**](https://mod.audio/dwarf/)
Main focus is on generating the sequence not the 303 sound.

## USAGE

Hit **space** to start playing the sequence. 

Hit **G** on your keyboard, or click the **SMILE** to generate new sequence.

### TODO

- rework the knobs to work with touch devices 
- output via MIDI, so you can control real synths
- euclidean mode
- store patterns
- find out the format of Polyend Play fills to make exports for it possible.
