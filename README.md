Main focus is on generating the sequence not the 303 sound.

## USAGE

Hit **space** to start playing the sequence. 

Hit **G** on your keyboard, or click the **SMILE** to generate new sequence.

### TODO

- output via MIDI, so you can control real synths
- euclidean mode
- store patterns
- find out the format of Polyend Play fills to make exports for it possible. 
- ?
